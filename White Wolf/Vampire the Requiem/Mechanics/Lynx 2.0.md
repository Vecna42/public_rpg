# Lynx
_"Don't only connect.  Disconnecting matters too."_

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT AND HISTORY

**Parent Clan:** Mekhet

**Nickname:** None

**Bloodline Disciplines:** Auspex, Celerity, Majesty, Obfuscate

**Bloodline Bane:** Each Lynx has one network they are obsessed with and must check in for a few minutes at least once a night to see what's new and to interact.  Being prevented (or perceiving that one is being prevented) from doing so is a Frenzy trigger at +0; the threat of being cut off entirely is a Frenzy trigger at -2.  This network should be represented with at least four dots worth of appropriate merits (Allies, Contacts, Retainer, Status, etc.).

***

## WEB
The Lynx gift of Web expresses their affinity for networks and connections that resides within their blood - as it does within all Vitae.  They have instinctive understanding of the networks they involve themselves in, and can even temporarily infiltrate into networks they don't belong to.

All Lynx gain the first Devotion, _SELECT FROM_, upon joining the bloodline.  Additional Devotions have prerequisites as normal, and cost 2xp each.

Lynx recognise the existence of four types of networks, and their powers have differing effects on each:
+ **Formal Social**: Primarily financial, who does business with whom, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Mental' network - Often reflected with merits such as: Mentor, Retainer, Resources, Status]
+ **Personal Social**: Primarily emotional, friends, lovers, sexual partners, enemies, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Social' network - Often reflected with merits such as: Allies, Contacts, Retainer]
+ **Spatial**: Primarily infrastructure, road and rail, electric wiring, sewers, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Physical' network - These networks aren't usually reflected with Merits]
	+ Outside of futuristic settings with advanced cybernetics (what sort of vampire game are you playing!?), Lynx are not naturally members of any spatial networks.
+ **Blood Sympathy**: Primarily Vitae, the bonds between kindred, ghouls, blood bonds, addiction, etc.
	+ [These networks aren't usually reflected with Merits]
	+ For the purposes of these powers a node may generally belong to two such networks: 'natural', such as blood sympathy between families of kindred, and 'artificial', such as the Viniculum.
	+ Artificially created blood sympathy (such as through the use of the Mnemosyne discipline "Meminisse") registers as part of the 'natural' network to these powers - which may cause the Lynx some confusion...
	+ Lynx are automatically members of the natural blood sympathy network that is their clan and with their blood relatives.
	+ Being blood bound automatically joins that artificial blood sympathy network.

***

### SELECT FROM
By accessing an existing, known node of a Network, a Lynx can use SELECT FROM to find links from that node to other nodes in a network.  The Lynx can only target networks to which they are attuned (either naturally or through CREATE LOGIN).

**Cost:** 1 Vitae.

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Investigation + Auspex - subject's Composure + Blood Potency.

**Action:** Instant.  Note, that while the actual activation of the power is an instant action the Lynx must spend a few minutes interacting with the node in some fashion.
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to interpret anything useful from the subject, and is overwhelmed with extraneous data.  They are unable to use this power again for the rest of the night, and the Vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Failure:** The character fails to observe anything useful.

**Success:**
+ _Social networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information about links from the node to the chosen network equal to successes {"He's pissed, look at him.  He hates his boss."} **OR** pick a Social merit (e.g. Allies, Contacts, Herd, Mentor, Retainer, etc.) and get information on dots up to successes.
+ _Spatial networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information on human traffic through the node: intensity, frequency, time of day, notable emotional states, etc.  {"Most of the calls through this box are inbound - and frightened." "Around midnight, that bridge fills up with foot traffic."}
+ _Sympathy networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information about bonds from the node in the chosen natural or artificial network.  The most prominent links are uncovered first (so first degree blood sympathy or a three-stage blood bond), and then weaker links are revealed with more successes.

**Exceptional Success:** Extra successes are their own reward, but an Exceptional Success with this power also reveals the information with greater clarity and with more information based on the subject node's perception of the link.

As always, the knowledge is filtered through the Beast - and many Lynx report seeing visual manifestations of the connections when they use this power: _social connections_ hanging as delicate golden threads, _blood sympathy_ as red cords, and blood bonds as heavy chains.  _Spatial networks_ blossom like a map of blood vessels behind the eyes.

***

### CREATE LOGIN
This power allows a Lynx to temporarily attune to a network they are not already part of.  This is always required for a _Spatial network_, and is generally required for _Social networks_ as well and for most _Sympathetic networks_.

The Lynx must be in the presence of a node of the network to activate this power, and be aware that the network exists.  They must spend a few minutes interacting with the node (talking to them, following them, spending time at the location, etc.) before activating the power.

This power only works on networks that the Lynx is not already part of - if they already have an equal or better version of any of the below effects, that effect takes precedence.

**Cost:** 1 Vitae

**Dice Pool:** Presence + Empathy + Majesty

**Action:** Instant.  Note, that while the actual activation of the power is an instant action the Lynx must spend a few minutes interacting with the node in some fashion.

**Duration:** 1 hour per dot of Blood Potency
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** 

**Failure:** 

**Success:**
+ _Social networks_: The Lynx insinuates themselves to the social network they have targeted and gains a temporary place in its hierarchy.  They develop an appropriate merit to represent this, e.g. Status, but at a value of 0 (granting no dice bonuses, ability to learn restricted information/powers, ask for favours, etc).  Other members of the network have a vague, instinctive sense that the Lynx is a member (although, as stated above, there is no mechanical benefit to this) but nothing concious or which prompts alarm on their part - Majesty smooths over any in-the-moment rationalisation required.
+ _Spatial networks_: The Lynx attunes themselves to a physical network.
+ _Sympathy networks_:
	+ If the Lynx chooses to create a 'natural' sympathetic connection, then they develop a _Four Times removed_ level of Blood Sympathy toward the Clan of the target.
	+ If they Lynx chooses to create an 'artificial' sympathetic connection, then both they develop a _First Stage_ blood bond to the target (the Lynx is the Thrall in this relationship) - with all the attendant upsides and downsides for both parties.  If, instead, they have a point of blood/Vitae from the target in their system and spend it in addition to the normal Vitae to activate this power they can instead forge a blood bond with the target as the Thrall.  If they have a point of blood/Vitae from two targets in their system, and spend both in addition to the normal activation costs, then they can create a blood bond between two other Kindred instead.

**Exceptional Success:** The effect lasts for 1 night per dot of Blood Potency instead.

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### INSERT INTO
This power allows the Lynx to attach themselves to a node in a Network, becoming part of the greater connection.  To use this, they must have first attuned to the network with CREATE LOGIN, and be in the presence of a suitable node of the network - it is this node to which they will forge the new links.  If they are already a member of the network then using INSERT INTO boosts their existing connection.

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per scene.

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Majesty vs. subject's Resolve + Blood Potency.

**Action:** Instant and contested; resistance is reflexive
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx achieves the opposite of the results they wanted, 

**Failure:** 

**Success:** Successes become bonus dice for rolls involving the network to which the Lynx has INSERTered themselves INTO.
+ _Social networks_: These networks usually provide bonuses on Social rolls when interacting with members of the network - any dice roll which might be affected by Status dots is a candidate for this effect.
+ _Spatial networks_: These networks provide a variety of rolls to apply the bonus to depending on the network.  E.g. using INSERT INTO on a road network might provide bonuses to Drive rolls while INSERTing INTO a CCTV network might provide bonuses to Computer rolls.
+ _Sympathy networks_:
	+ When used on 'natural' sympathetic networks, this power boosts the blood sympathy between the Lynx and the target.  Each success increases the level of sympathy between the Lynx and their target - from _Four Times remove_ to _Thrice removed_, etc.  The bonuses from this are only obtained by the Lynx, unless the Lynx has a point of blood/Vitae from the target into their system and spend it in addition to the Willpower to activate the power - in which case the target can be the recipient of the effects.
	+ When used on 'artificial' networks, the Lynx increases the effects of a blood bond by one per success - turning a _First Stage_ blood bond into a _Second Stage_, etc.  If this raises the blood bond to a _Third Stage_ it does not automatically break all other blood bonds as it would normally - instead the target is pulled in multiple directions at once.  The blood bond targeted can be one in which the Lynx is either Thrall or Regnant.

**Exceptional Success:** Additional successes are their own reward, but gaining an Exception Success on this power allows the Lynx to spend a Willpower at the end of the scene to extend the effect for another scene.  They may continue to do this as long as they have willpower to spend or until sunrise.

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### UPDATE WHERE


**Cost:** 1 vitae per connection

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Majesty vs subject's Resolve + Blood Potency

**Action:** Instant
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx looses control of their attempt, and end up being afflicted by the emotion themselves.  They take a -2 penalty to any frenzy checks for the remainder of the night, and the Vitae spent to activate this power is wasted.

**Failure:** The network is too difficult to update, and remains unchanged.  The vitae spent is wasted.

**Success:**  All changes listed below last for the remainder of the scene, but any effects wrought by the changed network will endure naturally - e.g. car crashes caused by UPDATE WHERE may lead to very real deaths.
+ _Social networks_: The Lynx can affect the connection between two nodes of a network, shifting the emotional value placed on it by a node at either end.  The Lynx targets a node in one of their Social networks that they can see, and applies an emotion of their choice to any number of their social connections - each connection costs one Vitae to change and the Lynx is limited by their normal round limits for spending Vitae.  The targeted node immediately feels the effect of the new emotion, but does not notice the  shift in emotion as unusual - no more than a victim of Majesty notices until after the fact.
+ _Spatial networks_: When affecting spatial networks, a Lynx can change the flow of traffic or information through connections by tainting them with an emotion.  Targeting a node in a network that they can see, use of this power is similar to the effects of _Social networks_ - how people perceive the section of network or the information in it is tainted by the emotion.  Ways this can manifest differently to above, though: 'good' flow can be attenuated to 'bad' flow (all the drivers on a stretch of road slow down to cause congestion) or 'bad' flow expanded into 'good' (pedestrians clear a path on a busy pavement).
+ _Sympathy networks_: 

**Exceptional Success:** 

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### DELETE FROM
This power allows the Lynx to remove themselves from their own networks - dampening the effectiveness of the links that connect them to others.  The Lynx feels out of place around the dampened network, as if they had an uncomfortable phantom limb.

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per scene.

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Obfuscate - subject's Resolve + Blood Potency.

**Action:**  Instant and contested; resistance is reflexive
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** 

**Failure:** 

**Success:** If used on a network that the Lynx is connected to via CREATE LOGIN, then that power is automatically ended early.

If used on a network that the Lynx is naturally part of then successes on this power become penalties for rolls involving interacting with the Lynx through the targeted network.
+ _Social networks_: These networks usually penalise Social rolls made by members of the network when interacting with the Lynx - any dice roll which might be affected by Status dots is a candidate for this effect.  In addition, this also affects the ability of those nodes to remember details about the Lynx, to notice them, or otherwise interact with them.
+ _Spatial networks_: As the Lynx is not naturally part of Spatial networks, the targets of this power are networks which currently hold data about the Lynx (such as a computer network that houses a database or a CCTV camera network that is observing the Lynx).  Dice rolls that might be penalised by this power are generally ones concerned with accessing/retrieving the data or noticing that it exists.
+ _Sympathy networks_: 
	+ When used on 'natural' sympathetic networks, this power dampens the effects of blood sympathy from the Lynx to the target.  Each success reduces the bonus the target gains from blood sympathy by one degree - from _Once Removed_ to _Twice Removed_, etc.  If this drops the level of connection below _Four Times Remove_, the Lynx does not register as a member of their clan to blood sympathy.  If, instead, the Lynx has a point of blood/Vitae from the target in their system and spend it in addition to the Willpower to activate the power then the target can be made the recipient of this power's benefit.
	+ When used on an 'artificial' sympathetic network, the Lynx reduces the effect of a blood bond by one step per success - turning a _Third Stage_ bond into a _Second Stage_, etc.  If this lowers the bond below _First Stage_ then the Lynx is free of their Regnant for the scene.  The blood bond targeted can be one in which the Lynx is either Thrall or Regnant.

**Exceptional Success:** Additional successes are their own reward, but gaining an Exception Success on this power allows the Lynx to spend a Willpower at the end of the scene to extend the effect for another scene.  They may continue to do this as long as they have willpower to spend or until sunrise.

**Prerequisite:** Obfuscate 2

### OUTER JOIN
The Lynx may spoof their victim's place in a network that they belong to.  

**Cost:** 2 vitae

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Subterfuge + Obfuscate - Resolve

**Action:** Instant and resisted; resistance is reflexive
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** 

**Failure:** 

**Success:**
+ _Social networks_: 
+ _Spatial networks_: 
+ _Sympathy networks_: 

**Exceptional Success:** 

**Prerequisite:** 

### The Meta-Web
In addition to the above devotions, the Lynx makes the following alterations or additions to their disciplines:
+ _Auspex 1_ Add the following questions:
	+ Who is the best-connected person in this room?  _A glittering spider-web of networks, centred on one person_.
	+ Who doesn't belong here?  _A lacuna in the sea of connections_.
+ _Auspex 2_: Add the following questions:
	+ Who is this person in Thrall to?  _An image of their Regnant(s), holding chains_.
	+ Who does this person hold in Thrall?  _Chains wrapped around the throat of the Thrall_.
	+ Which network is this person closest to? _The smell of sweat and semen at the swinger's club.  The sound of soft choral music.  The crackling of a ham radio_.
+ _Auspex 3_: Add the following questions:
	+

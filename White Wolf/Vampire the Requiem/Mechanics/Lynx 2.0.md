# Lynx
_"Don't only connect.  Disconnecting matters too."_

DESCRIPTIVE TEXT AND HISTORY

**Parent Clan:** Mekhet

**Nickname:** None

**Bloodline Disciplines:** Auspex, Celerity, _Majesty_, Obfuscate

**Bloodline Bane:** Each Lynx has one network they are obsessed with and must check in for a few minutes at least once a night to see what's new and to interact.  Being prevented (or perceiving that one is being prevented) from doing so is a Frenzy trigger at +0; the threat of being cut off entirely is a Frenzy trigger at -2.  This network should be represented with at least four dots worth of appropriate merits (Allies, Contacts, Retainer, Status, etc.).

***

## WEB
The Lynx gift of Web expresses their affinity for networks and connections that resides within their blood - as it does within all Vitae.  They have instinctive understanding of the networks they involve themselves in, and can even temporarily infiltrate into networks they don't belong to.

All Lynx gain the first Devotion, _SELECT FROM_, upon joining the bloodline.  Additional Devotions have prerequisites as normal, and cost 2xp each.

Lynx recognise the existence of four types of networks, and their powers have differing effects on each:
+ **Formal Social**: Primarily financial, who does business with whom, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Mental' network - Often reflected with merits such as: Mentor, Retainer, Resources, Status]
+ **Personal Social**: Primarily emotional, friends, lovers, sexual partners, enemies, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Social' network - Often reflected with merits such as: Allies, Contacts, Retainer]
+ **Spatial**: Primarily infrastructure, road and rail, electric wiring, sewers, etc.
	+ [Nominally a 'Physical' network - These networks aren't usually reflected with Merits]
	+ Outside of futuristic settings with advanced cybernetics (what sort of vampire game are you playing!?), Lynx are not naturally members of any spatial networks.
+ **Blood Sympathy**: Primarily Vitae, the bonds between kindred, ghouls, blood bonds, addiction, etc.
	+ [These networks aren't usually reflected with Merits]
	+ For the purposes of these powers a node may generally belong to two such networks: 'natural', such as blood sympathy between families of kindred, and 'artificial', such as the Viniculum.
	+ Artificially created blood sympathy (such as through the use of the Mnemosyne discipline "Meminisse") registers as part of the 'natural' network to these powers - which may cause the Lynx some confusion...
	+ Lynx are automatically members of the natural blood sympathy network that is their clan and with their blood relatives.
	+ Being blood bound automatically joins that artificial blood sympathy network.

**Suggested Modifiers:** All the usual bonuses for Blood Ties apply to uses of Web devotions; although uses of Web may modify the exact bonus, as described below.

***

### SELECT FROM
By accessing an existing, known node of a Network, a Lynx can use SELECT FROM to find links from that node to other nodes in a network.  The Lynx can only target nodes to which they are attuned (either naturally or through CREATE LOGIN).

**Cost:** 1 Vitae.

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Investigation + Auspex - subject's Composure + Blood Potency.

**Action:** Instant.  Note, that while the actual activation of the power is an instant action the Lynx must spend a few minutes interacting with the node in some fashion.
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to interpret anything useful from the subject, and is overwhelmed with extraneous data.  They are unable to use this power again for the rest of the night, and the Vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Failure:** The character fails to observe anything useful.

**Success:**
+ _Social networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information about links from the node to the chosen network equal to successes {"He's pissed, look at him.  He hates his boss."} **OR** pick a Social merit (e.g. Allies, Contacts, Herd, Mentor, Retainer, Status, etc.) and get information on dots up to successes.
+ _Spatial networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information on human traffic through the node: intensity, frequency, time of day, notable emotional states, etc.  {"Most of the calls through this box are inbound - and frightened." "Around midnight, that bridge fills up with foot traffic."}
+ _Sympathy networks_: Gain a number of pieces of information about bonds from the node in the chosen natural or artificial network.  The most prominent links are uncovered first (so first degree blood sympathy or a three-stage blood bond), and then weaker links are revealed with more successes.

**Exceptional Success:** Extra successes are their own reward, but an Exceptional Success with this power also reveals the information with greater clarity and with more information based on the subject node's perception of the link.

As always, the knowledge is filtered through the Beast - and many Lynx report seeing visual manifestations of the connections when they use this power: _social connections_ hanging as delicate golden threads, _blood sympathy_ as pulsing red veins, and blood bonds as heavy chains.  _Spatial networks_ blossom like a map of blood vessels behind the eyes.

**Suggested Modifiers:**

| Modifier | Situation |
|:-------- |:--------- |
| +2       | Used on a subject the Lynx has fed from |
| -2       | The subject and the Lynx do not share a language |
| -2 to -5 | The subject node is not interacted with properly; rushed interaction or a frightened/offended subject |

***

### CREATE LOGIN
This power allows a Lynx to temporarily attune to a network they are not already part of.  This is always required for a _Spatial network_, and is generally required for _Social networks_ as well and for most _Sympathetic networks_.

The Lynx must be in the presence of a node of the network to activate this power, and choose a network to join.  They must spend a few minutes interacting with the node (talking to them, following them, spending time at the location, etc.) before activating the power.

This power only works on networks that the Lynx is not already part of - if they already have an equal or better version of any of the below effects, that effect takes precedence.

**Cost:** 1 Vitae

**Dice Pool:** Presence + Empathy + Majesty

**Action:** Instant.  (Note, that while the actual activation of the power is an instant action the Lynx must spend a few minutes interacting with the node in some fashion beforehand.)

**Duration:** 1 hour per dot of Blood Potency
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx completely misjudges applying their powers, and are overwhelmed by the feedback received that they cannot use any other powers of Web on the target node for the rest of the night, and take a -2 dice penalty to any roll to interact with the node for the same period.

**Failure:** The Lynx fails to infiltrate the chosen network, and the vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Success:**
+ _Social networks_: The Lynx insinuates themselves to the social network they have targeted and gains a temporary place in its hierarchy.  They develop an appropriate merit to represent this, e.g. Status, but at a value of 0 (granting no dice bonuses, ability to learn restricted information/powers, ask for favours, etc).  Other members of the network have a vague, instinctive sense that the Lynx is a member (although, as stated above, there is no mechanical benefit to this) but nothing concious or which prompts alarm on their part - Majesty smooths over any in-the-moment rationalisation required.
+ _Spatial networks_: The Lynx attunes themselves to a physical network.
+ _Sympathy networks_:
	+ If the Lynx chooses to create a 'natural' sympathetic connection, then they develop a _Four Times removed_ level of Blood Sympathy toward the Clan of the target.
	+ If they Lynx chooses to create an 'artificial' sympathetic connection, then both they develop a _First Stage_ blood bond to the target (the Lynx is the Thrall in this relationship) - with all the attendant upsides and downsides for both parties.  If, instead, they have a point of blood/Vitae from the target in their system and spend it in addition to the normal Vitae to activate this power they can instead forge a blood bond with the target as the Thrall.  If they have a point of blood/Vitae from two targets in their system, and spend both in addition to the normal activation costs, then they can create a blood bond between two other Kindred instead.

**Exceptional Success:** The effect lasts for 1 night per dot of Blood Potency instead.

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### INSERT INTO
This power allows the Lynx to attach themselves to a node in a Network, becoming part of the greater connection.  To use this, they must have first attuned to the network with CREATE LOGIN, and be in the presence of a suitable node of the network - it is this node to which they will forge the new links.  If they are already a member of the network then using INSERT INTO boosts their existing connection.

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per scene.

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Majesty vs. subject's Resolve + Blood Potency.

**Action:** Instant and contested; resistance is reflexive
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx achieves the opposite of the results they wanted, and their connection to the network they targeted is disconnected: if it was an artificial connection created with CREATE LOGIN then it is just terminated, but for natural connections the Lynx's place in the network is suppressed for the remainder of the night.

**Failure:** The Lynx fails to bolster their position in the network, and the Willpower spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Success:** Successes become bonus dice for rolls involving the network to which the Lynx has INSERTered themselves INTO.
+ _Social networks_: These networks usually provide bonuses on Social rolls when interacting with members of the network - any dice roll which might be affected by Status dots is a candidate for this effect.
+ _Spatial networks_: These networks provide a variety of rolls to apply the bonus to depending on the network.  E.g. using INSERT INTO on a road network might provide bonuses to Drive rolls while INSERTing INTO a CCTV network might provide bonuses to Computer rolls.
+ _Sympathy networks_:
	+ When used on 'natural' sympathetic networks, this power boosts the blood sympathy between the Lynx and the target.  Each success increases the level of sympathy between the Lynx and their target - from _Four Times remove_ to _Thrice removed_, etc.  The bonuses from this are only obtained by the Lynx, unless the Lynx has a point of blood/Vitae from the target in their system and spend it in addition to the Willpower to activate the power - in which case the target is the recipient of the effects.
	+ When used on 'artificial' networks, the Lynx increases the effects of a blood bond by one per success - turning a _First Stage_ blood bond into a _Second Stage_, etc.  If this raises the blood bond to a _Third Stage_ it does not automatically break all other blood bonds as it would normally - instead the target is pulled in multiple directions at once.  The blood bond targeted can be one in which the Lynx is either Thrall or Regnant.

**Exceptional Success:** Additional successes are their own reward, but gaining an Exception Success on this power allows the Lynx to spend a Willpower at the end of the scene to extend the effect for another scene.  They may continue to do this as long as they have willpower to spend or until sunrise.

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### DELETE FROM
This power allows the Lynx to remove themselves from their own networks - dampening the effectiveness of the links that connect them to others.  The Lynx feels out of place around the dampened network, as if they had an uncomfortable phantom limb.

**Cost:** 1 Willpower per scene.

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Obfuscate - subject's Resolve + Blood Potency.

**Action:**  Instant and contested; resistance is reflexive
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx achieves the opposite of their goal, and their connection to the network is mystically bolstered.  For the remainder of the night, the Lynx is the first person that a member of the network will think to contact if they need something.

**Failure:** The Lynx fails to suppress their connection to the network, and the Willpower spent is wasted.

**Success:** If used on a network that the Lynx is connected to via CREATE LOGIN, then that power is automatically ended early.

If used on a network that the Lynx is naturally part of then successes on this power become penalties for rolls involving interacting with the Lynx through the targeted network.
+ _Social networks_: These networks usually penalise Social rolls made by members of the network when interacting with the Lynx - any dice roll which might be affected by Status dots is a candidate for this effect.  In addition, this also affects the ability of those nodes to remember details about the Lynx, to notice them, or otherwise interact with them.
+ _Spatial networks_: As the Lynx is not naturally part of Spatial networks, the targets of this power are networks which currently hold data about the Lynx (such as a computer network that houses a database or a CCTV camera network that is observing the Lynx).  Dice rolls that might be penalised by this power are generally ones concerned with accessing/retrieving the data or noticing that it exists.
+ _Sympathy networks_: 
	+ When used on 'natural' sympathetic networks, this power dampens the effects of blood sympathy from the Lynx to the target.  Each success reduces the bonus the target gains from blood sympathy by one degree - from _Once Removed_ to _Twice Removed_, etc.  If this drops the level of connection below _Four Times Remove_, the Lynx does not register as a member of their clan to blood sympathy.  If, instead, the Lynx has a point of blood/Vitae from the target in their system and spend it in addition to the Willpower to activate the power then the target can be made the recipient of this power's benefit.
	+ When used on an 'artificial' sympathetic network, the Lynx reduces the effect of a blood bond by one step per success - turning a _Third Stage_ bond into a _Second Stage_, etc.  If this lowers the bond below _First Stage_ then the Lynx is free of their Regnant for the scene.  The blood bond targeted can be one in which the Lynx is either Thrall or Regnant.

**Exceptional Success:** Additional successes are their own reward, but gaining an Exception Success on this power allows the Lynx to spend a Willpower at the end of the scene to extend the effect for another scene.  They may continue to do this as long as they have willpower to spend or until sunrise.

**Prerequisite:** Obfuscate 2

### UPDATE WHERE
As the Lynx grows to understand how to control emotions with Majesty, they learn to twist the existing connections of networks around them and to edit the information that flows through nodes.

A clever Lynx can use this power to set off much larger changes in a network: a frayed relationship may lead to a lucrative political clash, or a halt in traffic may keep unwanted pursuers at bay or dangerous reinforcements away.

**Cost:** 1 vitae per connection

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Majesty vs subject's Resolve + Blood Potency

**Action:** Instant
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx looses control of their attempt, and end up being afflicted by the emotion themselves.  They take a -2 penalty to any frenzy checks for the remainder of the night, and the Vitae spent to activate this power is wasted.

**Failure:** The network is too difficult to update, and remains unchanged.  The vitae spent is wasted.

**Success:**  All changes listed below last for the remainder of the scene, but any effects wrought by the changed network will endure naturally - e.g. car crashes caused by UPDATE WHERE may lead to very real deaths.
+ _Social networks_: The Lynx can affect the connection between two nodes of a network, shifting the emotional value placed on it by a node at either end.  The Lynx targets a node in one of their Social networks that they can see, and applies an emotion of their choice to any number of their social connections - each connection costs one Vitae to change and the Lynx is limited by their normal round limits for spending Vitae.  The targeted node immediately feels the effect of the new emotion, but does not notice the  shift in emotion as unusual - no more than a victim of Majesty notices until after the fact.
+ _Spatial networks_: When affecting spatial networks, a Lynx can change the flow of traffic or information through connections by tainting them with an emotion.  Targeting a node in a network that they can see, use of this power is similar to the effects of _Social networks_ - how people perceive the section of network or the information in it is tainted by the emotion.  Ways this can manifest differently to above, though: 'good' flow can be attenuated to 'bad' flow (all the drivers on a stretch of road slow down to cause congestion) or 'bad' flow expanded into 'good' (pedestrians clear a path on a busy pavement).  If used on a more informational connection (such as a computer network) then anyone perceiving the information flowing through the connection views it through the lens of the emotion (e.g. they might find the upset to read any e-mail arriving over their network connection, or angry at anything they witness on the CCTV monitor).
+ _Sympathy networks_: 
	+ For 'natural' networks, this power allows the Lynx to echo emotions throughout their family and clan.  However, shallower levels of connection require more effort and thus vitae: _Once Removed_ costs nothing extra, but _Twice Removed_ costs an additional vitae (for a total cost of 2 vitae) and each further step costs an additional vitae (for a total of 4 vitae for _Four Times Removed_).
	+ For 'artificial' networks, this power allows the Lynx to achieve effects similar to _Social networks_ but only targeting a blood bond (either as Thrall or Regnant).

**Exceptional Success:** The effects obtained from an Exceptional Success are more useful for the Lynx's desired aim, and the changes persist for the remainder of the night instead of the scene.  When used on 'natural' _Sympathy networks_, the effect can be targeted to all members of the network instead for an additional Willpower (this lasts for the scene not the night).

**Suggested Modifiers:**

| Modifier | Situation |
|:-------- |:--------- |
| -2       | The Lynx has only just met the subject for the first time |
| -3       | The Lynx has never met the nodes at the other end of the connections |
| -4       | The emotion applied is strongly out of line with the existing connection (e.g. making an angry widow regard her husband's killer with Charity) |

**Prerequisite:** Majesty 2

### The Meta-Web
In addition to the above devotions, the Lynx makes the following alterations or additions to their disciplines:
+ _Auspex 1_ Add the following questions:
	+ Who is the best-connected person in this room?  _A glittering spider-web of networks, centred on one person_.
	+ Who doesn't belong here?  _A lacuna in the sea of connections_.
+ _Auspex 2_: Add the following questions:
	+ Who is this person in Thrall to?  _An image of their Regnant(s), holding chains_.
	+ Who does this person hold in Thrall?  _Chains wrapped around the throat of the Thrall_.
	+ Which network is this person closest to? _The smell of sweat and semen at the swinger's club.  The sound of soft choral music.  The crackling of a ham radio_.
+ _Auspex 3_: Add the following questions:
	+ Where do most people passing through here go?  _A sense of rushing motion toward an exit_

***

## The Wider Web
The following devotions are more specialised or powerful effects that some elder Lynx may develop.  They are, as with the standard Web devotions, restricted to membership in the bloodline - but have standard costing and requirements for devotions.

### Phreaking
_(Majesty 2, Obfuscate 4)_

The Lynx may spoof their victim's place in a network that they belong to.

This requires a more overt display of power than many other Web Devotions - in that the Lynx must smear a point of their vitae on the target's skin, and at least a point of the target's vitae on their own skin.

If instead they wish to swap the networks of two other targets, they must smear a point of their own vitae on each target's skin _and_ a point of vitae from each target onto the other target's skin.

**Cost:** 2 vitae plus 1 vitae from the target (if the Lynx is the other target); 3 vitae plus 1 vitae from each target (if the Lynx is not a target.  All bar the first vitae (merely spent by the Lynx to activate the power) must be smeared on the targets as described above

**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Subterfuge + Obfuscate - Resolve (use the highest Resolve if there are two targets)

**Action:** Instant and resisted; resistance is reflexive and optional
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx gives up one of their own networks (e.g. all dots in Allies, or all their Thralls) for the night and receives nothing in return.  The activation costs are spent.

**Failure:** The Lynx cannot forge the connections required, and the vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Success:** For each success the Lynx may exchange one of the following with the two targets involved:
+ _Social networks_: 
	+ All of their Allies merits
	+ All of their Contacts merits
	+ All of their Mentor merits
	+ All of their Mystery Cult Initiation merits
	+ All of their Resources merits
	+ All of their Retainer merits
	+ All of their Staff merits
	+ All of their Status merits (mortal organisations)
	+ All of their Status merits (supernatural organisations)
+ _Spatial networks_: This power does not work on Spatial networks.
+ _Sympathy networks_: 
	+ All 'natural' sympathy, i.e. Blood Sympathy
	+ All 'artificial' sympathy, i.e. Blood Bonds

This effect expires when the sun next rises and may not be dismissed early, and the switch is not noticeable to anyone except the Lynx and the two targets involved, and any True Friends either target has; everyone else accepts their new positions without question.  However, any powers which highlight connections (e.g. SELECT FROM or The Meta-Web) between the two targets (and/or the Lynx) will reveal a supernatural connections.

**Exceptional Success:** The spoof lasts for a number of nights equal to the Lynx's Blood Potency, and may be dismissed at any time.

This devotions costs 3xp

### Social Influencer
_(Majesty 1)_

To the Lynx, being in the presence of a node is no different to accessing it through a network and with _Social Influencer_ they begin to reach out through physical networks to achieve their designs.

**Cost:** 5 vitae

**Dice Pool:** None

**Action:** Reflexive

**Effect:** By consuming vast amounts of precious Vitae as they activate it, the Lynx may extend the effects of Awe beyond their immediate presence. They may Awe anyone who sees them on live television, or hears them on live radio – or even the telephone, though it’s rather a waste. People watching the broadcast will be glued to the set, and will not touch that dial. They can’t induce people to come over who aren’t actually there, but they can make particular people they know are watching call in to the show.

This devotions costs 1xp

### Network Maintainer
_(Majesty 2)_

As the Lynx often maintains a wide network of contacts across the world, some of them learn to channel more powerful effects of Majesty into a distant conversation.

**Cost:** 1 vitae

**Dice Pool:** None

**Action:** Reflexive

**Effect:** By activating this power alongside Confidant and spending the extra Vitae, the Lynx may use it over any two-way connection, so long as they can be seen or heard and see or hear the other person.

This devotions costs 1xp

### Social Hub
_(Auspex 4, INSERT INTO)_

The Lynx spins the threads of blood around her and for the duration of the scene can create a temporary telepathic network between the participants of this power.

The network can only be created between Kindred: the vitae within a ghoul does not have enough of a resonant sympathy for the Lynx to be able to extract the relevant threads.  Furthermore, it only works on Kindred who agree to be part of the network when it is established.

**Cost:** 1 Willpower

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Socialise + Auspex

**Action:** Instant

**Duration:** Scene

**Effect:** For the scene, all the participants are considered to have a linked telepathic network.  This cannot be used to dig into the minds of those linked or even to read surface thoughts, but rather it is used to transmit the sounds, images, and sensations chosen by those in the network.

Anyone using powers which highlight connections (e.g. SELECT FROM or The Meta-Web) on a member of the network will observe that the members of the network are linked, but cannot tell what the links mean unless they also have Lay Open the Mind (Auspex 4).

**Suggested Modifiers:**

| Modifier | Situation |
|:-------- |:--------- |
| +2       | All those involved know Lay Open the Mind |
| +1       | All those involved are Lynx |
|  0       | Up to two targets |
| -1       | Up to four targets |
| -2       | Up to six targets |
| -3       | Up to eight targets |
| -4       | Up to ten targets |
| -5       | Over ten targets |

All the normal bonuses for Blood Sympathy also apply.

This devotions costs 5xp

### Console Log
_(Auspex 2, INSERT INTO)_

By marking a target with vitae, a Lynx can ensure regular updates on their target as they move through networks known to the Lynx.  The Lynx must choose a network of which they are part (either naturally or through CREATE LOGIN) and if their target encounters a node in that network, the Lynx receives a brief alert.

**Cost:** 2 vitae, one of which must be smeared on the target

**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex - subject's Resolve

**Action:** Instant

**Effect:** For the rest of the night, when the target moves between nodes of the specified network the Lynx receives a brief flash of information to alert them to this fact - similar to an activity log.  E.g.:
+ 22:45 - Mina entered Dracula's presence
+ 23:15 - Mina left Dracula's presence
+ 01:00 - Mina entered Van Helsing's presence
+ 01:05 - Mina entered John Seward's presence
+ 01:05 - Mina entered Quincey Morris' presence

On an Exceptional Success, the Lynx can either choose to receive a general sense of the emotional reaction the target has to encountering the node or a sense of significant actions performed in the presence of the node.  The Lynx must choose which effect they receive when they activate the power.  E.g.
+ 23:00 - Mina is fed upon
+ 01:15 - Mina receives a blood transfusion

### Location History
_(Auspex 3, Console Log)_

A Lynx who understands spatial networks can spin the sensations of The Spirit's Touch into a thread showing the past movements of an individual to whom they have a connection.  This devotion can be used at any location the target has visited in the past, but the signal decays with time and more recent haunts are better starting nodes.

The Lynx must be physically present at a spatial node in a network they are attuned to, and choose a subject to whom they are attuned.  They must then interact with the spatial node while they roll to activate the power.

If the Lynx targets a subject who is currently under an effect that would hide their location (such as Obfuscate) then they must first succeed at a Clash of Wills check before they can attempt to activate this power.  The same is true if the Lynx uses a starting node where the subject was under a similar effect.

**Cost:** 1 vitae

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Empathy + Auspex vs. subject's Resolve + Blood Potency

**Action:** Extended and Contested; One roll every 1 minute; Target successes required are equal to ???

The subject can choose not to contest _only_ if they are present and aware when the power is activated.

**Duration:** Hours equal to Blood Potency
#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The Lynx completely fails to connect to the subject and they cannot use this power on the same subject or on the same spatial node for the remainder of the night.  The vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Failure:** If the subject reaches the target number of successes before the Lynx, and the attempt fails.  The Lynx cannot attempt to use this power on the same target again for the remainder of the scene.  The vitae spent to activate the power is wasted.

**Success:** If the Lynx achieves the target successes before the subject, then they glimpse the fleeting impressions of the subject's passage through locations.  This manifests as sensations, flashes of visions, and shimmering silver threads strung through space as the Beast serves up snippets of information for them.

For as long as the devotion lasts, if the Lynx is in a place that the subject has been in the past then they can track the subject's movement.  This allows them to follow the subject from location to location - and they always have a sense of how old any particular part of the trail is, so if the subject passes through the same location multiple times, the Lynx can determine the most recent thread out of all of those there instead of having to endlessly retrace their steps.

Following forward in time may eventually bring the Lynx to the subject's current location, as long as they aren't too distant to reach in that time.  If they follow the subject backward in time, then the furthest back they can track is determined by the penalty they choose to take when activating the power (see below).

**Exceptional Success:** The Lynx forges a closer connection to the subject's locational map, and the effect lasts for night's equal to Blood Potency instead of hours.

**Suggested Modifiers:**

| Modifier | Situation |
|:-------- |:--------- |
| +2       | The subject is present when the power is activated |
| +1       | The Lynx tries to follow trails no more than an hour old |
| +0       | The Lynx tries to follow trails no older than tonight |
| -1       | The Lynx tries to follow trails formed last night |
| -2       | The Lynx tries to follow trails up to a week old |
| -3       | The Lynx tries to follow trails up to a month old |
| -4       | The Lynx tries to follow trails over a month past |

This devotion costs 2xp

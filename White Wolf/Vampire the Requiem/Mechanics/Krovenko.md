# Krovenko
_""_

Sometimes, life can play cruel tricks.  Vampires, whose existence revolves around blood and who crave it above all other substances and pleasures in the world, would be horrified at the thought there might exist a bloodline for which this need is acutely driven home.

The Krovenko, or Sons of the Blood, are an obscure Russian lineage of the Nosferatu clan whose unlives became irrevocably entwined with those of the Tsars of Russia that their vitae mutated in sympathy to the plight of Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.

**Parent Clan:** Nosferatu

**Nickname:** Tsar/Czars (by themselves) or Bleeders (by others)

**Covenant:** The founder of the Krovenko can trace their lineage back through centuries of influential Russian Nosferatu, and a proud history of powerful Invictus elders.  The bloodline and lineage is, by far and away, dominated by membership of the Invictus.

Next to them, the Lancea Sanctum claims more members, fuelled in part by the traditional links between the Covenants and by the sense of God's curse weighing down upon the lineage.

**Bloodline Disciplines:** Nightmare, Obfuscate, _Phlebotomy_, Vigour

**Bloodline Bane:** The Krovenko's blood has been twisted and cursed through their association with the Czar's lineage and mimics the issues surrounding the mortal genetic disorder haemophilia.  Their blood is slow to clot and heal, and any attempt to use vitae to heal costs them double the amount of vitae per attempt.  This means that where it would cost a normal kindred 1 vitae to heal 2 bashing, a Krovenko must spent 2 vitea to achieve the same effect (this does not allow them to spend 1 point of vitae to heal 1 bashing).  It costs 2 points of vitae to heal 1 lethal, and 10 points of vitae over two nights to heal 1 point of aggravated damage.

In addition to this, the Krovenko find their blood requires their constant vigilance to stay inside.  Normally when a kindred's rightmost health box is filled with lethal damage they don't suffer the “bleeding out” effect of mortals; however, a Krovenko does.  For every minute they remain in this state they bleed out 1 point of vitae and suffer 1 lethal wound.  This continues until they have no vitae left to bleed, or their health track is filled with aggravated damage (at which point they meet Final Death).

## Phlebotomy
### • Shark's Senses
The basic power of Phlebotomy allows a Krovenko to better sense the flow of that most precious of liquids: blood.

**Cost:** –

**Dice Pool:** N/A

**Action:** N/A

This power is always in effect, and allows the Krovenko to add their dots in Phlebotomy to their Blood Potency for determining at what distance they can smell blood.  It does not affect their ability to see spilt blood.

They also gain a rough idea of how badly wounded a mortal is, from the smell of how much blood is leaking out (a rough idea of how many health boxes are marked with lethal or aggravated damage).

### •• Sickly Pallor
With Sickly Pallor, the Krovenko learns to use the perceived thinness of her blood to mask her true potential, and lowers the power of her beast to observers. 

**Cost:** 1 vitae

**Dice Pool:** Wits + Subterfuge + Phlebotomy

**Action:** Instant

#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** The power fails to activate, and the Krovenko accidentally spends a number of Vitae equal to their Blood Potency – which is wasted and leaks out through their skin, ruining any clothes they are wearing.

**Failure:** The power doesn't activate, but the Krovenko can try again on the next turn.  The Vitae spent is consumed and wasted.

**Success:** For the purposes of Predator's Taint checks, the Krovenko appears to have a Blood Potency of one lower than their actual value (to a minimum of zero).  This applies if the other kindred involved are using Aspect of the Predator or similar powers.  Once activated, the power is considered to be “always on” until sunrise or until the character enters torpor.

**Exceptional Success:** As per Success, but the Krovenko's Blood Potency appears to be two less than it actually is (to a minimum of zero).

If the Czar's apparent Blood Potency drops to zero, they register as a ghoul to other Kindred instead of as a vampire.

**Suggested Modifiers**

| Modifier | Situation |
|:-------- |:--------- |
| -1       | Every point of Blood Potency above 5 the Krovenko has. |

### ••• Blood Flows Freely
Trace amounts of blood infected with haemophilia travel throughout the Krovenko's system at all times, but it is not until they learn Blood Flows Freely that they can make use of this fact.  When a Krovenko feeds, she automatically gains more vitae as she counters the inherent clotting properties of the vessel.

**Cost:** –

**Dice Pool:** N/A

When feeding from a mortal, a Krovenko gains 4 vitae for every 3 points of lethal damage caused.  However, the mortal gains a limited form of the hemophilia disorder.

For a number of weeks equal to lethal damage inflicted by feeding, the mortal suffers the effects of hemophilia.  This causes their blood to be slower when clotting, and can cause extra lethal damage from bleeding.  Storytellers should adjudicate as they feel necessary.  The duration of this effect is cumulative if a Krovenko feeds upon them again before the effect wears off.  That is to say: if they have a week left before the effect ends and a Krovenko feeds on them for 2 lethal they will add two weeks to the remaining duration, ending up with three weeks left.

If a Krovenko feeds from a vampire, for every 2 points vitae she takes from the vampire she receives 3 points.  The vampire fed from gains the Krovenko bloodline weakness for a number of hours equal to the number of points of vitae they lost.

If the Krovenko has Coil of Blood 2 () then they take

### •••• Blood Flows Easily
Further unlocking the ability of their blood to resist clotting and sticking, the Krovenko learns how to reduce the amount of vitae required to power disciplines and other effects.  However, their bloodline curse remains beyond their ability to affect.

**Cost:** 1 vitae

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Medicine + Phlebotomy

**Action:** Instant

#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** 

**Failure:** The Krovenko fails to make their blood more receptive, and the cost of the power is wasted.

**Success:** The Krovenko succeeds at making their blood flow easier, and for a number of rounds equal to successes the cost of using vitae to power an effect is reduced by 1 (to a minimum cost of 1 vitae).

**Exceptional Success:** An Exceptional Success gives no additional benefit above the increased duration and vitae savings.

However, Blood Flows Easily can never affect the cost of healing, as the vitae of a Krovenko is simply too frail to improve.

_Example:_ 

### ••••• Hematoma of the Flesh
Finally, a Krovenko reasons that if their blood is perceived to be ‘thinner' then there must be more room to accommodate vitae in their body.  This power allows just that effect to exist, for a short time, but causes the Krovenko's skin to darken into bruises as the extra blood pools in the muscles.

**Cost:** 1 vitae

**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Medicine + Phlebotomy

**Action:** Instant

#### Roll Results
**Dramatic Failure:** 

**Failure:** The Krovenko fails to activate the power, and cannot try again for another scene/hour.  The spent vitae is wasted.

**Success:** For a number of hours equal to successes, the Krovenko's Blood Potency is counted as one higher for one specific effect: vitae capacity.  Trait limits, vitae spending limits, potency of blood for Predator's Taint, or type of blood required to feed upon do not change when using this power.  The extra vitae is pressed in close to the surface of the skin, and stored in muscles and tendons rather than the blood vessels.  This causes the Krovenko to suffer bashing damage equal to successes, as their skin bruises and fills with blood.  This damage cannot be healed until the power ends.  Ending the power early is an instant action.

**Exceptional Success:** In addition to the increased duration, an Exceptional Success lets the Czar treat their Blood Potency as two higher for vitae capacity.

This power does not create extra vitae in the Krovenko's system; it simply creates more room for vitae.  The Krovenko must feed as usual if they wish to make use of this extra capacity.

When the power's duration wears off (or is canceled), any vitae still held in excess of the Krovenko's normal limit seeps out of their skin through their pores all over the body.  This has an unsettling on any kindred watching (and if relevant, may require onlookers to test for Vitae Addiction) and is generally considered to be a breach of the Masquerade if observed by mortals.  In addition, it almost certain ruins any clothing they are currently wearing as it becomes soaked in blood.

_Example:_ Alexandra activates Hematoma of the Flesh and gains three successes.  He has Blood Potency 5, which allows him to hold 14 points of vitae.  For the three hours this power lasts, he is counted as having Blood Potency 6 for the purposes of calculating his maximum vitae store which raises his limit to 15 points.  He is still limited to a maximum of 5 in attributes or skills, and cannot spend more than 2 points of vitae a turn.  He also suffers three points of bashing damage which he cannot heal until the power ends.

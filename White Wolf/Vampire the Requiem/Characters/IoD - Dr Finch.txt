--- BACKGROUND ---
Backstory

At 1.45am on Tuesday the 14th April, 1874 Daedalus Finch was born to parents Lucian Carver Finch and Arabella Elizabeth Mayvee in London, England.  His childhood was perfectly normal for the time, if a little more bloodied as the other boys at school resented his intellect and took it out in the form of beatings.  He soon learnt to run away when he saw them coming, or to hide.  A pattern that would latter define much of his Requiem.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  

Finch excelled at school, and went on to study at Oxford for a physics degree (obtaining a first) and then completed his PhD in the same subject by the end of 1898.  After University, he continued to work in theoretical physics and around this time became first interested, later fascinated and obsessed, with the occult. 

(Bullet point from here until I get a chance to flesh it out properly)
* In the summer of 1908 he was struck down with a bout of tuberculosis, and was packed off to the family home in Whitby to recover / die.
* Embraced 24th November 1908 while in Whitby and after being attacked.
* Beatrice kept him prisoner for about 15 years.
* Taught himself Ob 3, and Celerity 1 to help him escape.
* Ran off into the countryside.
* Lost humanity.
* Found his way to Stafford about 10 years later.
* Met the Archivist.
* Joined the Ordo.
* Upped humanity...
* Spent next 60 years or so learning coils, expanding knowledge, etc.
*   Tracked down remains of family.  His brother's children?
* Moved to Reading 2007 when last descendent of family did.


CHARACTER QUESTIONS (To be answered for all applications)
****
What are your character's reason(s) to continue existing?  What most motivates your character to interact with other characters? What fears, joys, or other emotions drive him or her?  What are his or her goals? What is your character willing to die for?

Reasons - Finch continues to exist firstly because like most, he is afraid to die.  However, on top of that, he is gripped with an icy passion (suitable for kindred who feel no real emotions) to transcend his current state and achieve whatever is waiting at the end.  His personal beliefs would indicate some kind of omniscience as one merges with Ein Soph (Hebrew, literally "without end", denoting "boundlessness" and/or "nothingness", which is a Kabbalistic term that usually refers to an abstract state of existence preceding God's Creation of the limited universe).

Motivations - Finch attends court (his only major interaction) primarily to observe other kindred, and make continued notes on his side research of observing how resistant the general kindred population is to change.  Additionally, he has picked up along the way a number of positions that require some modicum of attendance at court, and as of yet these haven't adversely affected his research time/efforts, so he persists in holding them until such time as change is required.
He also interacts with the Ordo on an infrequent basis.  He travels outside Reading only to attend the quarterly caucuses.  He does this to keep up to date on current policies, research, and threats.  He also recognises that he will find it difficult to continue to progress if he becomes a recluse.

Fears - Finch fears deeply that people may prove him wrong on something, and this manifests as firstly a reluctance to share his opinion on a matter unless its clear no one else knows the subject.  This can make him appear rather silent, as he finds it just easier to watch and learn (being of Clan Mekhet this comes somewhat naturally to him).
He also fears losing his mind to such a state that he can't continue his research, or that his research is in some way destroyed.  These are two of the reasons he has learnt the Ordo mental tricks for perfect memory and protection against mental intrusions (The three merits Mind of the ...).
Whitby.

Joys - Joy is not a common emotion among the cold dead withered hearts of the kindred, and Finch's is no exception.  Focusing his unlife on research and academia to the degree he has, this further removes him a step from such emotions, although they stir when he achieves some breakthrough in his research or when he proves someone else wrong.  These are the times he feels whatever passes for joy.

Other emotions - In recent nights Finch has felt what would best described as paternal pride as he watches his childe struggle through the start of her own requiem, and begin to pick up the habits and tricks that are required to survive.  He is also pleased with her progress within the Ordo, as she begins to master the self discipline and mental rigour required to achieve successful chrysalis.

Goals - Finch's long term goals are very simple.  Transcend.  He is, after all, a good little Ordo.  However, his shorter term goals include such things as: 

To die for - Finch is not overly willing to die for anything.  He's far too much of a coward to risk himself in such a fashion.  About the only thing he'd consider doing so for is to ensure that the Ordo continues on its way towards transcendence, however he is selfish enough to want to substitute someone else in his place to try and get there himself.

****
How does your character interact with the mundane world? (If your character possesses any supernatural qualities, please describe how he or she avoids undue attention from ordinary people.)

For the most part, Finch does not interact with the mundane world.  Due to his coils, he does not require kine to feed from and instead takes his sustenance from the animals around his haven (which is in the countryside, and thus both undisturbed and plentiful for animals).  If he does have to pass through areas where the kine are, he generally uses Obfuscate 3 to pass without notice.

****
What faction/group does your character most feels a part of (Clan, Covenant, Bloodline, Lineage, Coterie, etc., or venue equivalent)? Why that group? How does your PC interact with that group?  How does his relationship to the group affect his/her dealings with other groups he/she is a part of?  (For example, if lineage is most important, how does this impact his/her views of clan and covenant?)

Currently, Finch feels most a part of his lineage than any other group.
His declining confidence in the competency of most of the Ordo Dracul in the country does not encourage him to communicate with those outside of the small group he does trust (his mentor, his childe, and some who he knows are competent).
His clan as a whole doesn't feature highly in his unlife, as nothing seems to occur to warrant it to.  He is the clan Priscus for Reading, but nothing is ever brought to his desk.
His lineage (Domus Egregoroi) on the other hand is reasonable active, and he is in communication with a number of elements there within.

****
How does your character help to reinforce paradigm?  Does your character deviate from paradigm?  If so, how does this deviation add to the global chronicle?

Finch is a reasonably paradigm consistent member of both the Mekhet and of the Ordo Dying Light.  He watches quietly from the sidelines, and is never quite what he seems to be.  Carefully working at being in reasonable control without having to openly take it again.
His research is devoted to working out the route to transcend the kindred condition, and to escape the Curse.

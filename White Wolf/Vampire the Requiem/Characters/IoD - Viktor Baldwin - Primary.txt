Notes:
    Standard possession routine:  Possess Stefan (retainer C), and then have other retainers place the body in the Haven Tomb, and one (probably Albert (retainer A)) of them seal the tomb closed from inside, with the body.  The correct body is placed in a secret compartment within a marble bier.  On top of the bier is a body made up to look like Viktor, and dressed in the same sort of clothes he wears.  Elsewhere in the house (and thus outside the tomb), in the master bedroom, is a second body also dressed up in this fashion and laid out on a four-poster bed, arms crossed.

--- BACKGROUND ---
Timeline in 50 year blocks, with the major incidents and life-defining moments set out.  Also included, mortal events that interact with his life.

Kine
1676-1699: 
- 1676 ~ Born Viktor Baldwin to a wealthy German family.

Kindred
1700-1749: 
- 1700 ~ Embraced at New Year, to provide a Haven and an understanding of the modern world for his elder Invictus sire.
1750-1799: 
1800-1849: 
- 1804 ~ Joins the Malocusians.
- 1823 ~ Succeeds at turning his home against his sire and driving him out, and eventually into torpor.
- 1846 ~ Slips into a brief torpor to regulate his blood potency.
1850-1899: 
- 1892 ~ Wakes up from his nap.
1900-1949: 
- 1913 ~ Fearing that his sire might soon wake from torpor, he steels himself for a journey to England; spending so much time outside of his haven sapped his will and when he arrived in England, he initially set up in a small home until his mental state returned to a state capable of arranging for a larger and more suitable haven.
- 1940s ~ Met Eliza Chance.
1950-1999: 
- 1972 ~ Slips into torpor for a quick nap, with instructions to his retainers to maintain the house.

--- KNOWN BIOGRAPHY ---
* Name - Viktor Baldwin
    * Known as - The Spider
* Age - Physically, he seems in his mid-20s.  However, he has been dead over 300 years, and is a shrewd operator.
* Other 'facts':
    - He doesn't have a Covenant, because it gets in the way of conducting business with everyone.
    - His haven is ... strange.  Walls creek in ways they shouldn't, or doors open on their before you reach them.  Plus Viktor always seems to know who his guests are before they get to the front door.
    - Now and then he asks around to see if anyone knows if his sire has woken up in Germany yet.  He never says why...
    - Oddly, for a vampire, Viktor's Haven is a known location and he is happy to invite people to see him there.
    - Viktor has a friend, or an ally, or at the least, a contact in every organisation, cult, Covenant, Clan, or group going.
    - Viktor is never seen in person outside of his Haven.
    - Viktor is the sort of guy you go to if you need something finding out.  Whatever it is.

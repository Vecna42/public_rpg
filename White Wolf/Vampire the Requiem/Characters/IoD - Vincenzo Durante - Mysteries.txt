02. Do you have a nickname? What is it, and where did you get it?
    No.
03. What do you look like? (Include height, weight, hair, eyes, skin, apparent age, and distinguishing features)  
    Vincenzo is around five foot nine, with short white hair, balding on top.  His skin is pale with age, and stands at stark contrast to his totally black clothing.  He is slightly overweight, and wears dark mirrored glasses with an old fashioned frame which hoop backwards around his ears making the difficult to remove (accidentally or by a second party).

09. In your opinion, what is your best feature?
    The ability to remain calm and level headed, regardless of situation.
10. What's your real birth date?
    1st of January, 1500.
11. Where do you live? Describe it: Is it messy, neat, avant-garde, sparse, etc.?
    A 'gothic' town house on the outskirts of Southampton.  Two stories, wooden cladding on the outside walls, with a single story higher at the entrance in a small 'tower'.  On a flat section of the roof, behind the tower which grants access, a space has been cleared and a 'dark garden' established - nothing lives here, but water flows around gravel and rocks, which have been placed in an imitation of the Zen gardens of the East.  The ample gardens surrounding the house are well kept by Vincenzo's retainer during the day.
    Inside the house large windows look out on to the grounds, although large and thick curtains are kept firmly drawn over them during the daytime.  The rooms are neither cluttered nor sparse, but rather contains exactly as much as seems to be needed for the room's function.  As a whole the house is airily decorated, harking to the aesthetics of Japanese interior design - simplicity and minimalism.  The walls are painted in soft pastel colours, and each room has a few carefully and elegantly hand-drawn calligraphy.  Most of the house flooring is made from wood, and while not done in the traditional tatami, or rice straw, mats the overall look is appealing to the eye.  A single room, at the back of the house, is outfitted with the tatami mats in a traditional arrangement for tea ceremonies (four in a ring around the outside, and a half sized matt in the middle with a square cut out to allow access to the sunken hearth).  Vincenzo's study, on the first floor, is stark white and empty save for a selection of floor cushions and a low desk, positioned to be used while sitting on the floor.  The desk is made from a pale wood, merging in colour into the thick fibrous carpet.
    Yet, behind all the seeming pleasantry and minimalism there is a ruthless undercurrent of order and practicality.  The rooms haven't been knocked down to replace the walls with flimsy sliding paper which would all too easily let the sun and other kindred roam around the haven unchecked.  The walls are run through with meshing (not unlike chicken wire) to prevent use of the Protean devotions Flow Within or Pass Through, and all the windows have securely locking metal shutters which can be deployed remotely from several hidden locations in the haven, and at least one panic room is carefully hidden between artfully angled walls and furniture {mechanically this is represented by the Tomb merit}.
12. Do you own a car? Describe it.
    While Vincenzo does not own a car himself, as an elder vampire he does not have sufficient grasp of such things, but his retainer maintains a

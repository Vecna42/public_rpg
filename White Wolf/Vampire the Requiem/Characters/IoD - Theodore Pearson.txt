        No Predator's Taint, and all vampires within BP (2) yards gain successes in bonus dice to resisting frenzy and can't ride the wave.  The caster gains an aura of blessedness, with the impression she possesses an obvious spark of the divine.  This is perceived differently by each vampire: one may see that she has faintly glowing eyes, another may witness a halo around her head like sun glare.

--- BACKGROUND ---
Born at the turn of the century, the mortal who would become Dr Theodore Pearson, was captured in mind by the rise of that most modern of phenomena, the Silver Screen. Entranced by those figures he wished he could be: Gable, Grant, Valentino, Sinatra. Mesmerised by their counterparts who stood beside them: Garland, Hepburn, Hayworth, Davis.

The cult of celebrity that sprung up around them fascinated him in ways he could not fully explain and thus it perhaps came as no surprise to his sire, that ever effervescent of kindred Father Gabriel Montoya, that when he was brought into his new Requiem he at once began to surround himself with those who would adore him for his looks, his charm, his wit, his Majesty.

As he matured and his vitae aged like fine wine, his cult strengthened with the bonds of blood, he set out to make for himself a new name. A name that those very mortals he had once worshipped would come to worship instead. He opened his first surgery in the early 2000s, and didn't look back for almost ten years. When his thoughts turned once more to Europe and his home...

    Entitlement Bonus:
        For an area (Wyrd * 200) yards or a population (Wyrd * 1,000) people, the changeling pledges to care for it and help it become what they want (such as "artist's haven" or "business district").  This pledge lasts a month, and has the following effects:
            * Those who are in alignment with the purpose gain +1 environmental bonus to rolls in alignment with the purpose.  If they spend at least a full day there, they must make a weekly Resolve + Composure check to see if they can resist returning to the area for a few hours.
            * Those who are neutral (not opposed but not supporting) must make a Resolve + Composure check (with a +3) to stay for a number of days equal to successes.  Failure indicates they must spend a WP point at the end of the scene to remain, and make a new roll.
            * Those who are opposed to the purpose must make the same roll, without the bonus.
            * Supernatural creatures of any sort gain the +3 to the roll in the second two cases.
        If the character forsakes the pledge, the area turns against them and the purpose becomes "Make the character's life miserable" for a period of 3 months, with all the above effects.

1970-1979: 
- 1974 ~ Born in Inverness.
1980-1989: 
1990-1999: 
- 1992 ~ Moves to London to study Law.
- 1995 ~ Taken in June just after the end of his final Law exams, returns in August after results are announced but before his fetch can ruin his life.

- 1997 ~ Roots out a group of Loyalists around Inverness during a Summer recess, and before they can complete their plans he calmly and without any further thought executes them all.  Soon after the Hound Tribunal appears and offers him an opportunity to join.  He accepts.

- 2008 ~ On the 22nd January the government announced the appointments to QC, among whom was Perry Hound.

CHARACTER QUESTIONS
4. What most motivates your character to interact with other characters? What fears, joys, or other emotions drive him or her? What are his or her goals? What is your character willing to die for? What inspires your character?

Interacting - To watch for traitors.
Fears - Loosing in battle.
Joys - Concluding a trial in his favour.
Goals - To expunge all traitors from society, and then to be part of the glorious charge into Arcadia to wipe the weakened Fae from their grinning thrones.
To die for - Summer and the Freehold.



****
5. How does your character interact with the mundane world? (If your character possesses any supernatural qualities, please describe how he or she avoids undue attention from ordinary people.) 

Perry is a QC, and therefore highly involved with the mundane world.  His supernatural qualities that he may draw upon in his day-to-day life are such that they are not the sort of bring undue attention from those around him (he has no desire, for example, to use Burning Bright (Punishing Summer 2) to create light that blinds those near him).



****
SUPERNATURAL QUESTIONS

6. What faction or group (Covenant/Clan, Path/Order, Seeming/Court, Auspice/Tribe etc.) does your character most feel a part of? Why that group? How does their relationship to the group affect his or her dealings with other groups he or she is a part of? (For example, if lineage is most important, how does this impact his/her views of clan and covenant?) 

Perry feels most at home with his Entitlement (The Hound Tribunal) first and foremost, followed by his Court (Summer).  These two are highest because he finds his soul, heart, and mind to be consumed with a wrathful desire for vengeance and justice to be metered out to those who have done wrong.

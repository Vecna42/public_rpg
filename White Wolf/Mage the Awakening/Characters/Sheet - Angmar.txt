        1 (Sugar Lips, Honey Tongue) - Observe target for 20min, then deliver a compliment as the first thing said to the character.  Roll 9 (Mani + Soci + (Half Empathy round up)) vs Pres + Comp.  Success means the target suffers a -3 to further Social Resistance traits or rolls.
        2 (Stick and Move) - Retreat or feign disinterest.  Spend a WP, roll 8 (Pres + Subt) vs Wits + Empa.  Success means for the rest of the scene you gain a bonus to all Social rolls equal to half the target's Presence score (round up).
        3 (New Approach) - On loose a Social contest, spend a WP to force a re-roll.
        4 (Chip Away) - Put a character off balance through changing tacks.  Once per turn, make a Social roll and spend a WP.  Instead of the +3 to the roll, force a -1 Social penalty upon the target, cumulative up to -3 if repeated.  Drawback: If you fail a Social roll after successfully using this, the target loose the penalty and you can't use it on them again for the rest of the game session.

        Darksight: The darkness gives up its secrets, duplicating the Forces 1 "Nightsight" spell (see MET:A, p. 247) as a persistent power. The mage can also shift his perceptions to the vantage point of a shadow or a place shrouded in darkness by closing his eyes and concentrating, duplicating the Space 2 "Scrying Space" spell (see MET:A, p. 345), except that the power automatically fails if targeting a well-lit area.
        Tenebrous Shield: The mage's own shadow rises and twists to interpose itself in the path of attacks, providing five points of armour as a persistent power, just as the protection afforded by the Death 2 "Entropic Guard" spell (see MET:A, p. 209).
        Shadow Force: The mage can invoke tangible darkness per the Death 4 "Summon Shadows" spell (see MET:A, p. 222), triggered and controlled with evocative gestures automatically learned when the Artefact bonds to a host. The Eye can create any number of summoned shadows, but all evaporate to nothingness if touched by a single ray of sunlight.
        Shadow Horde: The mage can whisper into the darkness, conjuring servitors of primal nightmares given form by his words. This power duplicates the Spirit 5/Death 3 "Shadow Slave" spell (see MET:A, p. 372), except that the creatures dissolve instantly if exposed to sunlight and the mage can forgo the usual Mana cost by siphoning power directly from the Abyss. Such cheating has a price, however, prompting a degeneration check as if he performed the least sinful act deemed unacceptable for his Wisdom rating.

--- BACKGROUND ---
Bullet point version below.

* Raised by middle class parents.
* Dropped out of school during his A levels, and went to work for a local software company.  Worked there for a couple of years.
* Old friend from school he'd not heard from in a while contacted him out of the blue.
* Got involved in some low key, minor Satanism through this friend.  He wasn't sure at this stage if he really believed in it.
* After another couple of years, the \"Higher Ups\" in the cult decided he was trustworthy enough to be inducted into the Inner Circle.
* Here he was taught about the Dark One, and how to do luck magic to get what he wanted.
* He used this power to advance first his position in the company, and then when he started his own, to curse his rivals so he did better than them.
* This lead to him quickly becoming quite rich.

"Obsidian Computers was founded just over six years ago and appears to have a meteoric rise to success.  Headed by the charismatic Patrick Noble, 28, it has successfully navigated through the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and onto great things.  They have recently announced that they would be opening offices somewhere along the M4 corridor, and this has unleashed a flurry of speculation into what they are doing next.  Known for keeping his bold decisions a closely guarded secret, Noble isn't given anything away on this front.  Other notables in the industry have said:

'Patrick leads a charmed life.  Seems to bounce out of one tragedy straight into a golden handshake.  I remember last year he was bidding on a contract, and things seemed to be going his way.  Then they decided on the other bid; Ickle PCs.  Shortly after that, the CEO of Ickle PCs had some kind of car accident, and the board decided to scale back their operations.  Patrick ended up with the contract after all.  I think he donated some of the money he got from it to the recovery fund.  Very touching.  Charmed life though...'

'Patrick.  There's a man who spends too much of his time chasing skirts for my liking.  Trousers too if the rumours are to be believed.  If it wasn't for the fact that's he's become fabulously wealthy from it, I wouldn't trust his computer judgement as far as I could throw it...  He does seem to know what he's doing when it comes to business, even if he spends every evening in a different bar.'"

Obsidian Computers trades in all kinds of software.  Generally they accept contracts from other firms to write software for a specific purpose.  They also do a small but successful range of off-the-shelf software.  They are still a relatively small company, and as of yet have not floated on the stock market.  Patrick still runs everything, even if he doesn't actually go to the office that often.

Pat Noble.  Its privately owned, and entirely by him.  Publicly and privately.

> Who is (are) the public faces? Who are the ones in actual control?
Pat runs the company, but day to day management is devolved to the various VPs in charge of each section.  He maintains control though, and isn't afraid to use it when he has to.

> Who have what positions?
Pat Noble - CEO

> Where is (are) the office(s)/other building(s)?
One main office, in central London.

Fame (Business) 3 - Head of Obsidian Computers, a successful computer software business which has managed to navigate it's way through the economic climate without faltering or loosing customers.

Fame (Socialite) 2 - He's seen basically every night out on the town, seen around the best places to be in town.  He's about at the level where it's hip to be there if he is, but not yet where it's only hip to be where he is.

Fame 1 - General public profile bleeding through from Fame (Business and Socialite) to be a man that everyone at least talks about now and then.  Either about his latest scandal or how well his business seems to do regardless.  Or both.

CHARACTER QUESTIONS (To be answered for all applications) 
****
What are your character's reason(s) to continue existing?  What most motivates your character to interact with other characters? What fears, joys, or other emotions drive him or her?  What are his or her goals? What is your character willing to die for?

Patrick exists to assist the Dark One bringing about some sort of Armagedon/apocalypse scenario.  Other than that, he enjoys fine wines, sex, and money.
His shorter term goals are 
His joys in life are: corrupting innocents; seducing any man or woman he can; watching business rivals crumble; flying his plane.
His fears are: losing his powers; going broke; becoming unattractive; being uncovered as an Apostle.
Pat is mostly too scared of death to have anything he'd be willing to die for.  He fully expects the Dark One to be on the other side, and to punish him for failure if he dies before accomplishing anything.

****
How does your character interact with the mundane world? (If your character possesses any supernatural qualities, please describe how he or she avoids undue attention from ordinary people.)

Pat interacts with the mundane world normally.  He runs his business (Obsidian Computers) from London, never letting go his grasp on it even if he doesn't appear to be leading.  He mostly views people as conquests or challenges: those equal to him are rivals to bring down; those weaker are there to be conquered; those more powerful are grudgingly respected, but still he works to undermine them.
He hides his low magic abilities through the simple method of a) never talking about them to anyone who isn't already an Apostle and b) having a locked, windowless room in his apartment for performing rituals.  This is where he stores all his tools and books as well.

****
Does your character deviate from paradigm?  If so, how does this deviation add to the global chronicle?

Pat is fairly typical example of:
a) An apostle.
b) A scheming businessman.
c) A bed-hopping slut.

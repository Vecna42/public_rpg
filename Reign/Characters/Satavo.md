##  Physical Description
Satavo is a tall Uld, standing a notch above six and a half feet.  His blood red wings, when entirely unfolded, stretch to nearly twice this distance, and ominously proclaim him to be a flawlessly attuned Stormtongue.  His head is shaven bald, not a single hair is left, and if asked, he smiles and asks if you've ever been flying at speed and had to keep hair from your eyes...

He is a statuesque beauty, his features carved from the black rock of his skin.  All who see him find their breath momentarily catches - some find him irresistible and fascinating, whereas others shudder and detect a hint of the something unwholesome in his stance.

He dresses with the usual Uldish flair for the gaudy and flashy, although in these summer months he often forgoes a shirt to give his wings more freedom.  In the winter months he wears specially adapated clothing - something relatively common among the Stormtongues, thankfully.  He often attempts to hide his beauty behind a hood and veil, at least when travelling somewhere new, but here in Uldholm itself his height and wings mark him out all too quickly as Satavo.
